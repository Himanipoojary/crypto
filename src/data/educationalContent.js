    title: 'Understanding Dictionary Attacks',
    content: `A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected system by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. This technique exploits the human tendency to use common, easily remembered passwords that can be found in word lists.

Unlike brute-force attacks that try every possible combination of characters, dictionary attacks are more targeted and efficient. They use pre-compiled lists of common passwords, words, and their variations, making them significantly faster when targeting weak passwords.`,
    keyPoints: [
      'Dictionary attacks use wordlists instead of random combinations',
      'They exploit human password selection patterns',
      'Much faster than pure brute-force for common passwords',
      'Effectiveness depends on password complexity',
      'Can be enhanced with rules and mutations'

  weakHashes: {
    title: 'Why Weak Hashes Are Vulnerable',
    explanation: `Weak hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to dictionary attacks for several reasons:

1. **Speed**: These algorithms were designed to be fast, allowing attackers to test millions of passwords per second.

2. **No Built-in Salt**: Without salting, identical passwords produce identical hashes, making rainbow table attacks possible.

3. **Known Vulnerabilities**: Collision attacks have been demonstrated, undermining their cryptographic integrity.

4. **Lack of Key Stretching**: Modern password hashing functions apply the hash function multiple times, making attacks exponentially slower.`,
